            <h2>ðŸ’» Why I Chose This Program</h2>
            <p>
                I chose this program because I've always been interested in how the software I use on a daily basis functions, and I am interested in maybe making my own in
                the future. Growing up, I wanted to make my own video games, which led me to my interest in programming, and is why ultimately I ended up here.
